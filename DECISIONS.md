# PHCA v3.0 — Decision Log

This file records all significant design decisions made during implementation.
Every entry must reference the v3.0 specification section it affects.

## Decision D-001: G' Inference Engine — pgmpy exact junction tree for Phase 3.1

- **Date:** 2026-06-29
- **Author:** Lead Implementation Engineer
- **Category:** Tier 2 (implementation-dependent)
- **Option chosen:** pgmpy exact junction tree for Phase 3.1 (|V| ≤ 100)
- **Alternatives:** Pyro variational inference (slower at small scale), custom loopy BP (more complex)
- **Rationale:** pgmpy provides exact inference for small graphs covering all Phase 3.1 tasks. Pyro reserved for Phase 3.2+ larger graphs with learned CPDs.
- **v3.0 trace:** §2.2 Def 2.4b

## Decision D-002: Rust workspace with 3 crates (common, rpta, hpm-runtime)

- **Date:** 2026-06-29
- **Author:** Lead Implementation Engineer
- **Category:** Tier 3 (open for optimization)
- **Option chosen:** Separate crates for each component with shared common types
- **Alternatives:** Single crate, Python-only implementation
- **Rationale:** Rust components are performance-critical (RBTA, HPM) and need separate compilation units. Shared types in `phca-common` prevents duplication.
- **v3.0 trace:** §2.1 Def 2.2, §3.2 Def 3.4

## Decision D-003: GridWorld state vector = 3×size² + 9 dimensions

- **Date:** 2026-06-29
- **Author:** Lead Implementation Engineer
- **Category:** Tier 2 (implementation-dependent)
- **Option chosen:** Agent one-hot map + goal one-hot map + wall map (3×size²) + 3×3 local neighborhood (9)
- **Alternatives:** Full grid encoding, compact coordinates
- **Rationale:** One-hot agent/goal/wall maps provide unambiguous position encoding. Local 3×3 view enables local navigation without full grid visibility.
- **v3.0 trace:** Blueprint §D.1

## Decision D-004: structlog fallback to stdlib logging

- **Date:** 2026-06-29
- **Author:** Lead Implementation Engineer
- **Category:** Tier 3
- **Option chosen:** try/except ImportError with `_log()` helper function
- **Alternatives:** Make structlog a hard dependency, use only stdlib logging
- **Rationale:** structlog provides structured logging for production use. stdlib fallback ensures code works without it during initial setup. The `_log()` wrapper handles both APIs transparently.
- **v3.0 trace:** None (tooling)
